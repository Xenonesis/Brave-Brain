## 🔒 Security Rules Implemented

```javascript
- Users can only access their own data
- Authentication required for all operations
- Feedback is immutable once submitted
- Notifications cannot be deleted (for analytics)
- Proper userId validation on all writes
```

## 📈 Firestore Collections

| Collection | Purpose | Security |
|------------|---------|----------|
| `users` | User profiles | Owner only |
| `appUsage` | App usage tracking | Owner only |
| `notifications` | Notification history | Owner only |
| `gamification` | Points, badges, levels | Owner only |
| `analytics` | Daily analytics data | Owner only |
| `feedback` | User feedback | Owner only, immutable |

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Sync Analytics
```kotlin
val sync = AnalyticsFirestoreSync(context)
sync.syncDailyAnalytics(
    totalScreenTimeMs = 3600000,
    productivityScore = 85,
    blockedAttempts = 3,
    challengesCompleted = 5,
    challengesFailed = 1,
    usagePatterns = mapOf("peakHour" to 14)
)
```

### Track Notification
```kotlin
val sync = NotificationFirestoreSync(context)
sync.trackNotificationSent(
    type = "usage_warning",
    title = "Screen Time Alert",
    message = "You've exceeded your limit",
    context = mapOf("app" to "Instagram")
)
```

### Submit Feedback
```kotlin
val sync = FeedbackFirestoreSync(context)
sync.submitFeedback(
    feedbackType = "feature_request",
    rating = 5,
    comment = "Great app!",
    context = mapOf("version" to "0.21")
)
```

### Migrate Data
```kotlin
val helper = FirestoreMigrationHelper(context)
val result = helper.migrateAllData()
if (result.isSuccess) {
    helper.markMigrationComplete()
}
```
