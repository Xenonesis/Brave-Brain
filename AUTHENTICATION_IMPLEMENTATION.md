# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented mandatory authentication for the Brave Brain app. Users must now login before accessing any features.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Login Activity
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/bravebrain/LoginActivity.kt`
- Created a new login screen as the app's entry point
- Supports three authentication methods:
  - Email/Password login
  - Email/Password signup
  - Google Sign-In
- Validates user input (email format, password length)
- Shows loading indicators during authentication
- Persists login state using SharedPreferences
- Redirects to onboarding or main activity based on completion status

**Layout:** `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_login.xml`
- Material Design 3 components
- Clean, professional UI with app logo
- Email and password input fields with proper validation
- Three action buttons (Login, Create Account, Google Sign-In)
- Progress indicator for async operations

### 2. Manifest Updates
**File:** `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Changed launcher activity from `OnboardingActivity` to `LoginActivity`
- Made `OnboardingActivity` and `MainActivity` non-exported for security

### 3. Authentication Checks

#### MainActivity
- Added `isUserAuthenticated()` method to verify login state
- Added `redirectToLogin()` method to handle unauthorized access
- Checks authentication in both `onCreate()` and `onResume()`
- Added logout functionality with confirmation dialog
- Added logout button to the UI

#### OnboardingActivity
- Added same authentication checks as MainActivity
- Prevents bypassing login by directly accessing onboarding

### 4. Logout Feature
- Added logout button to MainActivity dashboard
- Confirmation dialog before logout
- Clears authentication state from SharedPreferences
- Signs out from Firebase
- Stops all running services
- Redirects to login screen

## Authentication Flow

```
App Launch
    ↓
LoginActivity (Check if already logged in)
    ↓
    ├─ Already Logged In → Check Onboarding Status
    │                          ↓
    │                          ├─ Complete → MainActivity
    │                          └─ Incomplete → OnboardingActivity
    │
    └─ Not Logged In → Show Login Screen
                           ↓
                       User Authenticates
                           ↓
                       Check Onboarding Status
                           ↓
                           ├─ Complete → MainActivity
                           └─ Incomplete → OnboardingActivity
```

## Security Features

1. **Session Persistence**: Login state is saved locally and verified with Firebase
2. **Activity Protection**: All activities check authentication on create and resume
3. **Secure Logout**: Clears all auth data and stops services
4. **Non-Exported Activities**: Main activities can't be launched externally
5. **Firebase Integration**: Uses existing FirebaseAuthManager for secure authentication

## User Experience

1. **First Time Users**:
   - See login screen
   - Create account or sign in with Google
   - Complete onboarding
   - Access main app

2. **Returning Users**:
   - Automatically logged in if session is valid
   - Direct access to main app
   - Can logout anytime from dashboard

3. **Logout**:
   - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental logout
   - Clean state clearing
   - Smooth transition back to login
