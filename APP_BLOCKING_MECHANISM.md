# App Blocking Mechanism

## Overview
The app uses a multi-layered approach to ensure blocked apps are really stopped when time limits are reached.

## How It Works

### 1. Continuous Monitoring
- **ImprovedBlockerService** runs as a foreground service
- Checks every 1 second (1000ms) for foreground app
- Tracks usage time for blocked apps in real-time

### 2. Time Limit Detection
When a blocked app reaches its time limit:
```kotlin
if (currentUsageMinutes >= timeLimitMinutes) {
    blockAppImmediately(packageName)
}
```

### 3. Multi-Method Blocking
The `executeBlocking()` method uses 4 different techniques:

#### Method 1: Overlay Blocking
- Shows a full-screen overlay over the blocked app
- Prevents user interaction with the app
- Most effective visual blocking

#### Method 2: Force Kill App Process ✅ ENHANCED
```kotlin
private fun forceKillApp(packageName: String) {
    // Kill background processes
    activityManager.killBackgroundProcesses(packageName)
    
    // Clear app from recent tasks
    val runningTasks = activityManager.appTasks
    for (task in runningTasks) {
        if (taskInfo.baseIntent?.component?.packageName == packageName) {
            task.finishAndRemoveTask()  // Removes from recents
        }
    }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Kills all background processes of the app
- Removes the app from Android's recent tasks list
- Forces the app to completely restart if opened again

#### Method 3: Redirect to Home
- Sends user back to home screen
- Interrupts the blocked app immediately

#### Method 4: Blocking Activity
- Shows a full-screen blocking message
- Fallback if other methods fail

### 4. Continuous Re-Access Monitoring
After blocking an app, the service monitors for 30 seconds:
```kotlin
private fun startContinuousMonitoring(blockedPackage: String) {
    // Checks every second for 30 seconds
    // If user tries to reopen, blocks again immediately
}
```

## Blocking Flow

```
User opens blocked app
    ↓
Service detects app in foreground
    ↓
Checks time limit
    ↓
Limit exceeded?
    ↓ YES
Block immediately:
  1. Show overlay
  2. Kill app process ✅
  3. Remove from recents ✅
  4. Redirect to home
  5. Show blocking activity
    ↓
Monitor for re-access (30 seconds)
    ↓
If reopened → Block again
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Process Killing
- **killBackgroundProcesses()**: Terminates all app processes
- **finishAndRemoveTask()**: Removes app from recent apps list
- App must fully restart if user tries to open again

### ✅ Immediate Response
- 1-second check interval ensures quick detection
- Multiple blocking methods execute simultaneously
- No delay between detection and blocking

### ✅ Persistent Blocking
- Continuous monitoring for 30 seconds after block
- Automatic re-blocking if user tries to reopen
- Notifications sent for repeated access attempts

### ✅ Multiple Fallbacks
- If one method fails, others still work
- Overlay + Kill + Redirect + Activity = comprehensive blocking
- Ensures app is blocked even on different Android versions

## Android Limitations

**Note:** Android security prevents apps from:
- Force-stopping other apps (requires system permissions)
- Completely preventing app launches (user can always override)
- Accessing root-level process management

**What we CAN do:**
- ✅ Kill background processes
- ✅ Remove from recent tasks
- ✅ Show blocking overlays
- ✅ Redirect to home screen
- ✅ Monitor and re-block immediately

## Testing the Blocking

1. Set a 1-minute time limit on an app
2. Use the app for 1 minute
3. Observe:
   - App should be killed
   - Redirected to home screen
   - Blocking overlay appears
   - App removed from recents
4. Try to reopen the app:
   - Should be blocked again immediately
   - Notification about repeated access

## Logs

Check Android Logcat for blocking events:
```
ImprovedBlockerService: BLOCKING: [app] already over limit!
ImprovedBlockerService: Killed processes for [app]
ImprovedBlockerService: Removed task for [app]
ImprovedBlockerService: Redirected to home
ImprovedBlockerService: Started continuous monitoring
```

## Summary

The app **DOES** kill blocked app processes using:
1. `killBackgroundProcesses()` - Terminates app processes
2. `finishAndRemoveTask()` - Removes from recent tasks
3. Continuous monitoring - Re-blocks if user tries to reopen
4. Multiple blocking layers - Ensures comprehensive blocking

This provides the strongest possible blocking within Android's security constraints.
